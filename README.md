# SFTP-Nvim

A simple yet powerful Neovim plugin that allows you to save SFTP server configurations, upload files, and download files/folders from remote servers with an intuitive interface.

## Features

- 📁 **Bidirectional Transfer**: Upload files to remote server and download files/folders from remote
- ⚙️ **Project-based Configuration**: Save SFTP configuration per project directory
- 🔐 **Dual Authentication**: Support for SSH key and password authentication
- 🎯 **Smart File Selection**: Visual distinction between files (📄) and folders (📁)
- 🔍 **Telescope Integration**: Uses vim.ui.select() for better UX (works with Telescope, fzf, or fallback)
- 📦 **Recursive Downloads**: Download entire folders or individual files
- ⌨️ **Simple Commands**: Easy-to-use commands and key mappings

## Installation

### For LazyVim

Copy the `lazy.lua` file to your LazyVim plugins directory:

```bash
cp lazy.lua ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/sftp-nvim.lua
```

Or add the plugin configuration directly to your LazyVim setup:

```lua
return {
  "rafaelsieber/sftp-nvim",
  config = function()
    require("sftp-nvim").setup()
  end,
  cmd = {
    "SftpSetup",
    "SftpUpload", 
    "SftpConfig",
    "SftpDownload"
  },
  keys = {
    { "<leader>fs", "<cmd>SftpSetup<cr>", desc = "Setup SFTP config" },
    { "<leader>fu", "<cmd>SftpUpload<cr>", desc = "Upload current file via SFTP" },
    { "<leader>fc", "<cmd>SftpConfig<cr>", desc = "Show SFTP config" },
    { "<leader>fd", "<cmd>SftpDownload<cr>", desc = "Download file from remote via SFTP" },
  },
}
```

### Local Development

If you're developing this plugin locally, make sure to set `dev = true` in your plugin configuration and ensure the plugin path is in your runtimepath.

## Usage

### Commands

- `:SftpSetup` - Configure SFTP connection settings
- `:SftpUpload` - Upload the current file to the remote server
- `:SftpUploadDir` - Browse and upload files/directories from local to remote server
- `:SftpDownload` - Browse and download files/folders from remote server
- `:SftpConfig` - Show current SFTP configuration

### Key Mappings (default)

- `<leader>fs` - Setup SFTP config
- `<leader>fu` - Upload current file
- `<leader>fU` - Upload files/directories (with selection)
- `<leader>fd` - Download files/folders from remote
- `<leader>fc` - Show SFTP config

### Configuration File

The plugin creates a `.sftp-config.json` file in your project root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "host": "your-server.com",
  "port": 22,
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password",
  "remote_path": "/var/www/html",
  "use_key": false,
  "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

### Path Mapping Behavior

All transfer commands use path mapping relative to your current Neovim working directory (`:pwd`):

- Local project root (cwd): `/home/user/Local`
- Remote base (`remote_path`): `/home/user/Remote`
- Local file: `/home/user/Local/utils/file.txt`
- Remote target: `/home/user/Remote/utils/file.txt`

This same mapping rule is used consistently for:

- `:SftpUpload` (upload current file)
- `:SftpUploadDir` (upload selected file/directory)
- `:SftpDownload` (download selected file/directory)

If you upload a file that is outside your current Neovim working directory, the plugin uploads it to `remote_path/<filename>` to avoid unexpected absolute-path mirroring on the remote host.

### Workflow

#### Upload Workflow
1. Open your project in Neovim
2. Run `:SftpSetup` to configure your server connection

**Upload Current File:**
3. Open any file you want to upload
4. Run `:SftpUpload` or press `<leader>fu` to upload the current file

**Upload Files/Directories:**
3. Run `:SftpUploadDir` or press `<leader>fU`
4. Select from the list of local files and directories:
    - 📁 Directories are listed first
    - 📄 Files are listed after directories
5. If the remote file/directory exists, you'll get a confirmation dialog
6. The entire directory structure will be preserved and uploaded recursively

#### Download Workflow
1. Ensure SFTP is configured (run `:SftpSetup` if needed)
2. Run `:SftpDownload` or press `<leader>fd`
3. Browse the remote files and folders:
   - 📁 Folders are listed first
   - 📄 Files are listed after folders
4. Select any file or folder to download to your current working directory

## User Interface

The download feature provides an enhanced user experience:

- **Telescope Integration**: If you have Telescope installed, you'll get a beautiful fuzzy-findable picker
- **fzf Support**: Works with fzf-lua for fast native selection
- **Fallback UI**: Simple vim selection menu if no picker is available
- **Visual Distinction**: Clear icons distinguish between files and folders
- **Cancelable**: Press `<Esc>` to cancel the selection

## File Structure

The plugin is organized in a modular structure:

```
lua/sftp-nvim/
├── init.lua        # Main entry point and command registration
├── config.lua      # Configuration management
├── path.lua        # Shared path mapping helpers
├── upload.lua      # File upload functionality  
└── download.lua    # File/folder download and browsing
```

## Requirements

- Neovim with Lua support
- `scp` command available in your system
- For password authentication: `sshpass` (optional, for non-interactive password input)

## Authentication Methods

### SSH Key Authentication (Recommended)
- Set `use_key` to `true` during setup
- Specify path to your private key
- Ensure your public key is added to the remote server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### Password Authentication
- Set `use_key` to `false` during setup
- Enter your password (stored in config file - be careful with file permissions)
- Requires `sshpass` for non-interactive uploads

## Security Notes

- The configuration file contains sensitive information (passwords, paths)
- Consider adding `.sftp-config.json` to your `.gitignore`
- SSH key authentication is more secure than password authentication
- Set appropriate file permissions on the config file: `chmod 600 .sftp-config.json`

## Examples

### Setting up SSH key authentication:
1. Generate SSH key: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`
2. Copy to server: `ssh-copy-id user@your-server.com`
3. Run `:SftpSetup` and choose "key" authentication
4. Specify key path (usually `~/.ssh/id_rsa`)

### Directory structure example:
```
your-project/
├── .sftp-config.json
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── utils.js
└── README.md
```

**Upload**: When uploading `src/main.js`, it will be uploaded to `remote_path/src/main.js` on the server.

**Download**: When downloading from remote, files and folders are downloaded into your current working directory while preserving their path relative to `remote_path`.

## Recent Updates
